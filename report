The current issues with your website (What are your problems? Why do you need plugins?).
Plugins are important to add new and functional features to your website and make it more interesting, user friendly, etc. 
Issues are that it may look too simple, not enough 'fancier' features as it is just page by page. 

Problem I encountered - I wanted to connect my social media project onto the website, and I had no clue how to. But i realised a plugin might help so i downloaded social media slider in order to connect it and it worked! It also displays my posts and follower count as well as a carousel of my posts. Makes it so easy to display my side projects on wordpress. 

o Your choice of plugin provider and why you chose one plugin provider over the others (for example: Elementor vs Divi). I chose Elementor over Divi as it was more begginner friendly, as well as it being really easy to use and implement.

o The high-level steps of how you implemented each plugin. Going into add new plugin and selecting, downloading and activiating the ones you want. 

o The applicable benefits realized or expected to be realized after implementing each plugin
Elementor made it so easy to switch my website up and edit photos, insert text, add media etc. Social media plugin allowed me to set up a carasoul of my posts and make it look really awesome on my website.
